            Farming is a tough business. Even small-scale greenhouse farmers, who grow 
            vegetables, herbs, or mushrooms in controlled environments, face many 
            challenges. Crops are sensitive, resources are limited, and profit margins are 
            tight. One mistake—buying too much fertilizer, overwatering, or planting too 
            many crops—can mean wasted time, wasted money, and wasted harvest.<br><br>
            What if there was a simple way to make smart decisions, reduce waste, and 
            increase profits—without complicated spreadsheets, heavy accounting, or 
            expensive equipment? That’s where GreenSense comes in.

                    <h3>Transaction Tracking</h3>
                    <p>Transaction Tracking involves GreenSense recording 
                        every purchase and sale made by a farmer.
                        Farmers can log these purchases (like seeds, fertilizers, or soil)
                        and sales (of crops to a market or restaurant) through a mobile phone or computer. 
                        This step ensures all everyday farm transactions are 
                        captured and provides the raw data needed for analysis.</p>

                    <h3>AI Insights</h3>
                    <p>The AI Insights feature automatically analyzes the collected
                        data on expenses, sales, and crop performance. GreenSense uses
                        intelligent analysis to calculate key metrics,
                        such as the profit per crop, the cost per plant,
                        and seasonal trends. This analysis answers critical questions for farmers, 
                        including which crops are making the most money and where too much money is being spent.</p>

                    <h3>Alerts and Suggestions</h3>
                    <p>Alerts and Suggestions is the mechanism through which the platform provides proactive 
                        and timely advice to the farmer. 
                        The system sends alerts if a crop is performing poorly or
                        if costs are higher than usual. Conversely,
                        it can also suggest that a very profitable crop should be planted more often.</p>
